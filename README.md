# Accommodation-Management-System_MERN
Second-Year-2nd Semester Project

For the module "IT Project" in the 2nd year 2nd semester of our degree programme, we were required to select a topic that addresses a real-world problem. Our group chose the issue of finding and managing accommodation, which is a common challenge for students, lecturers, and employees near universities or workplaces. While seekers struggle to find options that match their preferences in cost, location, and facilities, accommodation owners face difficulties in advertising, managing tenants, and handling utilities and maintenance efficiently.

To address these challenges, our five-member team developed ApeBodima.lk, a comprehensive web application that simplifies both the accommodation search and property management processes. The platform offers targeted advertising with advanced filters, effective financial handling, real-time booking and reservations for visits and facilities, and automated report generation. ApeBodima.lk serves as a user-friendly bridge between accommodation seekers and owners, providing an all-in-one solution to the limitations of existing platforms and fulfilling real-world needs with practical features.
